<h1 class="text-center">An asset is a static file</h1>

<div class="note">
An asset is content which is static from the perspective from many users.
These files are typically CSS and javascript. These assets are often many and
not very space effective. Example: You split your javascript into multiple files
for easy development, but that is no good for the browser, since it has to
download all those files. Many requests to the web server slows down the website.

<div class="note">
...that's why I created Mojolicious::Plugin::Bootstrap3.
When you use this plugin, you will get all the Bootstrap3 features
without downloading a single css/js-file. You can also customize
the behavior right from the plugin or override the different SASS
files, like "_variables.scss" for defining your own colors and such.

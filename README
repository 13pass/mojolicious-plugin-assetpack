NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack - Pack css, scss and javascript with
    external tools

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    In production mode:

    This plugin will automatically compress scss, less, css and javascript
    with the help of external application. The result will be one file with
    all the sources combined.

    This is done using "pack_javascripts" and "pack_stylesheets".

    In development mode:

    This plugin will expand the input files to multiple javascript / link
    tags which makes debugging easier.

    This is done using "expand_moniker".

SYNOPSIS
    In your application:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      plugin 'AssetPack' => {
        assets => {
          'app.js' => [ '/js/foo.js', '/js/bar.js' ],
          'app.css' => [ '/css/foo.less', '/css/bar.scss', '/css/main.css' ],
        },
      };

      app->start;

    In your template:

      %= asset 'app.js'
      %= asset 'app.css'

    NOTE! You need to have one line for each type, meaning you cannot
    combine javascript and css sources on one line.

    See also "register".

APPLICATIONS
  less
    LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins,
    operations and functions. See <http://lesscss.org> for more details.

    Installation on Ubuntu and Debian:

      $ sudo apt-get install npm
      $ sudo npm install -g less

  sass
    Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested
    rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. See
    <http://sass-lang.com> for more information.

    Installation on Ubuntu and Debian:

      $ sudo apt-get install rubygems
      $ sudo gem install sass

  yuicompressor
    <http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor> is used to compress javascript and
    css.

    Installation on Ubuntu and Debian:

      $ sudo apt-get install npm
      $ sudo npm -g i yuicompressor

ATTRIBUTES
  out_dir
    Defaults to "packed" in the first search path for static files.

METHODS
  pack_javascripts
      $self->pack_javascripts($moniker => \@files);

    This method will combine the input files to one file in the "out_dir",
    named "$moniker".

    Will also run "yuicompressor" on the input files to minify them.

  pack_stylesheets
      $self->pack_stylesheets($moniker => \@files);

    This method will combine the input files to one file in the "out_dir",
    named "$moniker".

    Will also run "less" or "sass" on the input files to minify them.

  expand_moniker
      $bytestream = $self->expand_moniker($c, $moniker);

    This method will return one tag for each asset defined by the
    "$moniker".

    Will also run "less" or "sass" on the files to convert them to css,
    which the browser understand.

    The returning bytestream will contain style or javascript tags.

  find_external_apps
    This method is used to find the "APPLICATIONS". It will look for the
    apps usin File::Which in this order: lessc, less, sass, yui-compressor,
    yuicompressor.

  register
      plugin 'AssetPack', {
        enable => $bool,
        reset => $bool,
        yuicompressor => '/path/to/yuicompressor',
        less => '/path/to/lessc',
        sass => '/path/to/sass',
        assets => {
          'app.js' => [ '/js/foo.js', '/js/bar.js' ],
          'app.css' => [ '/css/foo.css', '/css/bar.css' ],
        },
      };

    Will register the "compress" helper. All arguments are optional.

    "enable" will default to COMPRESS_ASSETS environment variable or set to
    true if "mode" in Mojolicious is "production".

    "reset" can be set to true to always rebuild the javascript one the
    first request that hit the server.
